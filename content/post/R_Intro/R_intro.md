Before installing R-Studio you can  work through a few of RStudio's introductory lessons. You can do these in your browser and type code and see results there.

You'll learn some of the basics of R, as well as some powerful methods for manipulating data with the **dplyr** package. 

Complete these:

- **The Basics**
	- [Visualization Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1)
	- [Programming Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)
- **Work with Data**
	- [Working with Tibbles](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2.1)
	- [Isolating Data with dplyr](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2.2)
	- [Deriving Information with dplyr](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2.3)
	
The content from these primers comes from the (free and online!) book [*R for Data Science* by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
