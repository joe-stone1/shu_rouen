Sheffield Hallam University (UK)/ University of Rouen Normandy (France) 

1. Introduction

Current models of athlete development and support in preparation for performance tend to be dominated by isolated specialists working in silos, guided by a reproductive philosophy of athlete development and sport performance, which may be coordinated, but lacking deep integration offered by a Department of Methodology. Problems and challenges with traditional models of athlete development and performance preparation were outlined by Ross, Gupta and Sanders (2018). They discussed the barriers to changing practice in sports organisation, drawing attention to the inertia for meaningful change that is inherent in such systems. Their ideas dovetail with views expressed on the pitfalls of adhering to traditional forms of life in elite sports organisations, discussed elsewhere (see Rothwell, Davids & Stone, 2018; Chow, Davids, Shuttleworth & Araújo, in press).
	Analysing athlete performance in competitive performance environments, from an ecological dynamics perspective, supports an evidence-based rationalization of significant constraints which shape successful performance behaviours, providing the basis for designing representative training, preparation and learning contexts. This has been illustrated in relation to athlete preparation and practice design in several sports (Greenwood, Renshaw & Davids, 2014). The targeting of specific constraints on physical, psychological, cognitive and perceptual demands of competitive performance environments on individual athletes can be met by a group of practitioners working within a Department of Methodology in an elite sports organisation. The framework of ecological dynamics can be integrated with experiential knowledge of skilled and experienced elite practitioners to provide a comprehensive theoretical rationale to coordinate their work in supporting the self-regulation of each performer. This new model of athlete development and preparation for performance can support coaches and sport practitioners to explore and exploit functional intentions, specific performance goals and movement solutions aligned with context-specific demands of competition. 
	
2. Aims and objectives of the summer school 

Aims of the Summer School are: 
1. For Rouen University and Sheffield Hallam University students to work collaboratively in a Department of Methodology to offer sport science support for athlete development and preparation for performance,
2. Present and evaluate analyses of performance to understand how performers satisfy interacting constraints and how practice task constraints may be designed to elicit learning and development during practice and training.
3. To provide an international experience to the students and the staff from Sheffield Hallam University and the French university of Rouen, Normandy. 

Objectives: 
1.  To integrate the framework of ecological dynamics with students own experiential knowledge to provide a comprehensive theoretical rationale to coordinate performance analysis and coaching practice.
2. To observe, analyse, and identify performance challenges in a Professional Women’s Football Team and define the problem for notational analysis or field observation. 
3. Develop a notational system or use a valid observational tool to facilitate tactical or behavioural understanding. 
4. Plan and present an appropriate coaching interventions to improve performance and interpret the findings through the use of theoretical concepts and a range of technologies to measure and evaluate collective team behaviours. 
3. Overview of the School 
Throughout the school students will work in small teams to evaluate and define a performance related problem in a Women’s Professional Football Team. Students will have access to a range of data and video provided from Statsbomb.com and Wyscout. 
Your team will adopt the role of the coaching team for a professional English women’s team. You will be given a team, and a future fixture. 
Students will then be required to develop a baseline team report on their team using the data available for the season to date.  Replicating the time pressure of a weekly football match, you need to identify possible weaknesses in your opponents and design training to prepare the team for the up-and-coming fixture. 
You should outline how this training will be implemented using a Department of Methodology. Of particular interest is how the theoretical framework of ecological dynamics informed their work, identified performance problems, notational systems, the delivered intervention, and the changes in tactical or behavioural changes.
