**Department of Methodology in Sport Performance**  

*Introduction and Overview of the School*  

The school brings together Sheffield Hallam and Rouen university students to work in small teams to solve applied sport science problems. The 2022 summer school has a focus on Women’s Professional Football Teams. 

Each student group will adopt the role of the coaching team for a professional English women’s team. Using a range of data sources, the groups will evaluate and define a performance related problem and seek to develop intervention strategies.

*Aims and objectives of the summer school* 

Aims of the Summer School are: 
  - For Rouen University and Sheffield Hallam University students to work collaboratively in a Department of Methodology to offer sport science support for   athlete development and preparation for performance
  - Present and evaluate analyses of performance to understand how performers satisfy interacting constraints and how practice task constraints may be designed to elicit learning and development during practice and training
  - To provide an international experience to the students and the staff from Sheffield Hallam University and the French university of Rouen, Normandy. 

Objectives: 
- To integrate the framework of ecological dynamics with students own experiential knowledge to provide a comprehensive theoretical rationale to coordinate performance analysis and coaching practice
- To observe, analyse, and identify performance challenges in a Professional Women’s Football Team and define the problem for notational analysis or field observation
- Develop a notational system or use a valid observational tool to facilitate tactical or behavioural understanding.
- Plan and present an appropriate coaching interventions to improve performance and interpret the findings through the use of theoretical concepts and a range of technologies to measure and evaluate collective team behaviours
